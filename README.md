# Datasets-EmergentSystemLab

This is a data set created for learning spatial concept.  
This dataset includes the position on the map, the orientation on the map, and the images taken there.  
The position on the map is the self position of the robot estimated by MCL.  
Data was taken at Emergent System Laboratory room at Ritsumeikan University.  
Emergent System Laboratory room is the office environment.  
The image dataset is divided into fifteen because the file size is too large.
